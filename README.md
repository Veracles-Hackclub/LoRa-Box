# LoRa-Box
A Belt mounted LoRa node with an external antenna, a cool screen, and a buzzer to notify you of new connections/detected node.

Since it's hip mounted it will be incredibly easy to keep on me, and connect to with a LoRa app or website! It'll also have an external antenna I can hook up to a future amplifier if I want to.
